# Koye's Dotfiles

This is a custom repository containing all of my dotfiles. The trailing underscore before every file in the root directory implies the '.' prefix.

Installation: Clone this repository into your user's home directory, name it `.dotfiles`, and replace your dotfiles with links to the files in the directory.

TODO: Create a script for creating links to the .dotfiles folder

TODO: Create a script for moving dotfiles into the repo

TODO: Create an install script for dependencies
